1. To Enable NMT

-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=[off | summary | detail]

Note:
"class"  refers to  CompressedClassSpaceSize (Compressed Class space is part of the metaspace)
To set the size -XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize=2g

# The total  Metaspacesize is not displayed

2. Use jcmd to Access NMT Data

jcmd <pid> VM.native_memory [summary | detail | baseline | summary.diff | detail.diff | shutdown] 


3. -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch
Pre-touch the Java heap during JVM initialization. Every page of the heap is thus demand-zeroed 
during initialization rather than incrementally during application execution.
